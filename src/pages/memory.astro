          The MRover team would like to honor the memory of Jacqueline Tardif, a graduate of Michigan's Aerospace
          Engineering Program and former MRover president, who passed away due to Covid-19 complications in January of
          2021.
        </p>

        <p>
          Jackie served as team lead from 2010 to 2013. She was extremely devoted to her work and was responsible for
          much of the team's foundations in its early days. We owe MRover's official establishment as a WSTPC team to
          Jackie as well as the funding needed to build the team's first few rovers which she worked hard to amass.
        </p>

        <p>
          Following her graduation, Jackie went on to work as a lead mechanical engineer for the Aerospace Corporation
          in El Segundo, California, designing and building satellites, two of which were launched into orbit from the
          International Space Station. Additionally, Jackie devoted herself to working with special needs children
          through horseback riding and STEM outreach programs in her spare time.
